# End User Acceptance Testing

The feedback of our users is important to us. Though this is a short course and the site hasn't been ready for deployment that long, we have created a form for our users to fill out once they use the site. The form will be linked on `The_club_triton` repository, with a message encouraging them to give us feedback. Below, we will link both the form and its results.
