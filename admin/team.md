## Team brand

# Values:
- Accountability: Take responsibility as a member of the team and any parts of the project you are working on. This includes things like being on time to meetings and communicating early and often if a conflict comes up.
- No judgement: Limit judgement on other members of the group not related to the project itself, as we want the group to be a safe space to share ideas and not worry about whether or not an idea will come across as "dumb". 
- Empathy: Value empathy, whether that's trying to understand team members when conflicts arise, or designing for the end user.
