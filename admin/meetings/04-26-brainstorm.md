## Project requirment

- Crud app -- create, read, update, delete
- something about cards
- no multiplayer games that require network
- limit dependencies
- time constrained
- User-centered design

## Project Idea

- study flashcards - update flashcards, store, pretty clear. Anki. Combine game and study? subway surfers to the background. build in study features

- card collecting - pretty clear. pretty common idea

- website where you could write cards to ppl with different themes - could make a card and save it, have a database of made cards / in progress

- business card app - virtual business card, build, edit, generate qr code for business card. networking event among researchers; can't ask for insta so exchange business card. Custom character also --

- club penguin card game -- which was shut down - you log in and it would keep track of your stats or smth. maybe make the game a little more complicated, CRUD component would be mainly for tracking stats. College system? Cards related to parts of the college (e.g Muir has a sun god card, warren beats muir, Revelle beats all =) ) -- integrate into the card game card collecting. some kind of studying component? Strong cards --> answering question gets you cards, allows you to use cards, enhance power of cards

- tarot card reader - keep track of readings, option to save, delete, regenerate

- connections but stuff related to ucsd - smaller cards combine into one big card -- save acct of stats?? daily streaks

- smth to do with the college system? compete against ppl from different colleges. CRUD the stats/leaderboard
