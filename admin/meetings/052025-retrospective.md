# Sprint 1 Retrospective (06/20/2025)

### Attendance: Katy, Zhenyu, Chencheng, Nick, Jaylynne, Ryan, Chung Yin, Haoting, Pranay, Destin, Zack

### What did we do? 
- Set up the basic html home page & game page
- Set up the initial game logic
- Set up the custom html element for future development
- Set up the essential CI/CD pipeline
- Pair people in small groups and work together


### What went well?
- We made some good progress in our coding: we have most of the separate elements but still need to combine them
- Coding in small teams: small enough teams so that communication isn’t too difficult, but lower bus factor 

### What didn’t go as well? 
- Communication within groups, time conflicts, clear understanding of the task 
- Communication in terms of different parts being dependent on each other
- Time management: conflicts for members throughout the week

### Ideas for improvement/action items:
- Github projects: for each individual group, there will be a project board. We will use the Kanban template with the boards “Backlog”, “In progress”, and “Done”. Github issues will be used to populate the boards, with correct members assigned and detailed descriptions. Github projects to keep track of contribution between small teams and status of projects.
- Clearer definition of tasks and more granular, deliberate subtasks. These should be demonstrated through creating Github sub-issues. Larger subtasks will be defined in the full team, and it is up to the small groups to create and delegate these sub tasks. 
- Discuss conflicts up front. What do members have the capacity to do? Do we anticipate time conflicts? These need to be addressed at the beginning of the sprint. 
- Define a strict deadline for each major feature, and for those who can’t finish by then, their task will be taken care of by others and they will lose participation opportunities.
