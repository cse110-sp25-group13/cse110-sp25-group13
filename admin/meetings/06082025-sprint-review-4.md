# Sprint Review 3 (6/01/2025)

### Present:
Katy, Zhenyu, Pranay, Nick, Haoting

## Demo of develop 
### What works:
- Cards populate, and there is a distinction between IndexedDB (holds all the cards) and LocalStorage (holds the user's active cards)
- Well-designed nav bar with logo and icons
- Animation and custom background for front page
- Smooth game loop with improved card designs
- Smooth dropdown for projection instructions in custom font with custom arrow icons
- Collection page with selection ability, and the logic that the user must pick at least 10 cards to enter the game
- a 404.html page that the user is taken to if there is ever a messed up url
- Browser tests 

## Still need to do (NOW):
- Fix element element element in instructions
- Merge Zack's PR optimizing images for a faster load and adding fallback images
- Deploy to main !!

## Future features (past the scope of this class): 
- Fix some animation aspects
- Add more game logic -- make it more difficult for the player to win
- Add login page
- Add ability to discover new cards
- Game lobby? This would require network but multiple users

## Overall:
- We have a working demo, an avenue for end-user feedback, a 404 fallback page, fallback images, custom designs, it's pretty good! We've come a long way. Go team.
