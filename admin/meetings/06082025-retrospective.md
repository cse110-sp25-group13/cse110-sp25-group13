# Sprint 4 Retrospective (06/08/2025)

### What did we do? 
- Game demos! Main game loop, each individual team
- Each go around and share what we did and what we think worked well this time 

### What went well?
- Lots of engagement on Slack
- Consistent use of #stand-up
- Good use of Github project boards and issues
- Good communication among teams and within teams
- Good ownership of individual tasks
- Better adherence to intended workflow


### What didnâ€™t go as well? 
- Still up against a deadline, a bit chaotic
- Didn't get to implement all the features we wanted
- Some people weren't able to participate as much as they wanted
- Some miscommunications about tasks and who was doing what; more confirmation in terms of assigning tasks for Github Issues is needed

### Ideas for improvement/action items:
- Gotta work on the video! We will take our improved teamwork into this task
- Divided up into teams and we will keep each other informed as to what we are doing and how long our clips are
- Though we don't get to add any more code after tonight, we still can continue sending out the user acceptance form

Instead of doing a Miro board, we took turns sharing and then we played Club Penguin. :)
