# Use Github projects to track progress for sprint #2

## Context and Problem Statement

In our retrospective meeting for sprint 1, we discussed ways to improve communication both within and between groups. We had previously used Slack to keep track of tasks, as well as Github issues. However, we decided that Slack is not as conducive to the Github environment and Github issues themselves, while helpful, cannot "cover" the whole project. We will use Github Projects as a visual way of representing the tasks we need to get done, and this will help assign individual credit and align groups. 

## Considered Options

* Slack project tracker ONLY
* Github issues ONLY
* Slack project tracker and Github issues
* Some other board-like program, such as Trello 

## Decision Outcome

We choose to use Github Issues and Github Projects because this requires less "spread" and provides a better representation of progress divided amongst a group. Plus, different groups with dependent features can check out another group's board and get a better idea of what needs to be implemented on their end.

### Confirmation

At the beginning of the next sprint, tasks will be divided. The leaders will create boards for each team, and from there, it is up to the team to maintain the boards. "Maintaining" means keeping the Projects updated with descriptive, modularized issues, with the correct people and status assigned. We will use the Kanban template and only keep the columns "Backlog", "In progress", and "Done".
