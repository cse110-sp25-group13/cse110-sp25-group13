The "UCSD College Card Compare" game project requires a robust solution for managing game card data on the client-side. Key requirements influencing this decision include:

1.  **Offline Capability:** A core project goal is for the MVP to be playable offline after initial asset loading.
2.  **Card Data Management:** The game involves a master list of approximately 30 static card definitions (attributes like name, type, rank, rarity, description, image placeholders), initially sourced from a `cards.json` file.
3.  **User-Specific Data (Sprint 2/3 Requirement):** Users must be able to have a personal collection of cards they "own," with the ability to add and remove cards from this collection. This collection needs to persist across game sessions.
4.  **Performance & Efficiency:** Card data will be frequently accessed for rendering (e.g., by the `<triton_card>` component, on the collection page, and for player's hand) and for game logic (e.g., card comparisons).
5.  **Data Structure:** Card data is structured (objects with multiple properties).

Alternatives considered included:
*   **`localStorage`**: Deemed too limited for storing structured objects efficiently and for the potential size of the master card list or user collections. Also, querying capabilities are minimal.
*   **Fetching `cards.json` on demand**: While simple for initial load, this approach does not support offline gameplay and can lead to performance issues with repeated fetching/parsing if card data is frequently accessed or becomes large. It also doesn't inherently support persistent user-specific collections.

**Decision:**

We have decided to **utilize IndexedDB as the primary client-side database** for storing and managing all game card data and user-specific collection information.

The implementation will involve:

1.  **A master `cards` object store:**
    *   This store will hold all static card definitions.
    *   It will be populated once from `src/card-data/cards.json` during the initial database setup (`onupgradeneeden` event or an initial population check).
    *   The `id` property of each card object will serve as the `keyPath`.
2.  **A `playerOwnedCards` object store:**
    *   This store will manage the list of card IDs that the player owns.
    *   Each record will be an object `{ cardId: "unique_card_id" }`, where `cardId` is the `keyPath`.
    *   This allows for efficient addition, removal, and checking of owned cards.
3.  **JavaScript Module (`card-system.js`):** All IndexedDB interactions (initialization, data population, CRUD operations for master cards and owned cards) will be encapsulated within this module, providing a clear API for other game components.
4.  **Data Flow:** Game components requiring card details (e.g., for display or game logic) will primarily query IndexedDB via the `card-system.js` API after the initial data load.

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**

*   **Robust Offline Capability:** The game will be fully playable offline once card assets and data are cached in IndexedDB.
*   **Improved Performance for Data Access:** Reading data from IndexedDB is generally faster for subsequent access compared to re-fetching and parsing JSON files, especially for larger datasets or frequent lookups.
*   **Structured Data Storage:** IndexedDB is well-suited for storing and retrieving JavaScript objects, matching our card data structure.
*   **Persistent User-Specific Collections:** Allows for reliable storage of each user's card collection that persists between sessions, fulfilling a key Sprint 2/3 requirement.
*   **Scalability for Queries:** IndexedDB supports indexes (though not heavily used in the initial MVP, future-proofs for more complex queries like filtering by type, rarity, etc.).
*   **Transactional Integrity:** IndexedDB transactions help ensure that operations like adding or removing multiple cards to a collection are atomic.

**Negative/Risks:**

*   **Increased Initial Complexity:** The IndexedDB API is more verbose and complex than `localStorage` or simple `fetch` calls, involving asynchronous operations (Promises), transactions, versioning, and event-driven callbacks (`onsuccess`, `onerror`, `onupgradeneeded`). This requires a steeper learning curve.
*   **Browser-Specific Storage:** Data is stored locally within the user's browser. It is not synced across different browsers or devices without additional server-side logic (which is out of scope for the current MVP).
*   **Initial Setup & Versioning Overhead:** Requires careful management of database versions and the `onupgradeneeded` event for schema changes and initial data population. Errors in this process can lead to an unusable database state for the user until cleared.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging IndexedDB operations can sometimes be less straightforward than debugging simpler storage mechanisms. Browser developer tools for IndexedDB are good but require familiarity.

**Impact on Other Systems/Teams:**

*   **`card-system.js`:** This module becomes the central point l√°grimas for all card data logic. Its API needs to be clear and robust.
*   **`<triton-card>` Component & UI Pages (Collection Page, Game Page):** These components will rely on `card-system.js` to asynchronously fetch card data (either full objects or IDs) for display. UI elements for adding/removing cards from collection will call functions in `card-system.js`.
*   **Game Logic Team (Team 1):** Will use `card-system.js` to retrieve card objects (based on IDs of cards in play) to access attributes like `ranking`, `type`, etc., for comparison logic.
*   **Development Workflow:** Team members working with card data will need a basic understanding of the asynchronous nature of data retrieval from `card-system.js` (i.e., working with Promises).
