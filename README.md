## âœ… Project rubric
| Category | What we did | Links |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Pull request reviewing | um what did we do | idk |
| Branching use | Branching name strategy: name-what-you-did | branches perhaps |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Linting, formatting, tests (with coverage): unit tests, end to end tests, browser tests, JSDocs | Folder |
| Issue Tracking | Used a feature format, linked issues to project boards with parent issues, kept these boards up to date | Link smth |
| Repo use: Tagging/releases | something | something |
| Docs (README.md) | There are READMEs for directories | alskdjf;alskdfjal;skdjg |
| Design Related Docs | We created wireframes for our initial designs, game flows, collected inspiration for page designs, and mocked out designs before coding. | [design-docs](admin/design-docs) |
| UCD Related Docs | From the pitch to the end of the project, we kept user stories in mind as we created our issues. Check the linked document for a list of the user stories we continually referenced. | [user-stories.md](specs/user-stories.md) |
| Architectural Related Docs | ???? | ????? |
| System Related Docs | We created system diagrams for the general flow of the site as well as system diagrams for our CICD pipeline. | [pipeline chart](), [system-diagrams]() | 
| Team & Managerial Related Docs | Every team/managerial related document that was referenced as an assignment in Canvas is uploaded to its correct spot. We also have other documents, such as meeting plans, sprint plans, and Miro boards in this repository. | Links |
| Developer Docs | Every time a PR is successfully merged to `develop`, our JSDocs workflow is triggered, updating our developer docs. Something else? | Links |
| Doc Location & Doc DX | Not sure we should include this | Links |
| Doc Synchonicity with Code/System | Our system diagrams (pipeline and website flow) have different versions, including a most-updated version. Our developer docs are updated **as the code is updated**, so they are synchronous with each other. | Links |
| Backlog Use | We used Github Issues and Project Boards (specifically the `Backlog` column) to keep track of our backlog. Per the Agile methodology, backlogs were sorted through and updated at sprint reviews, then added to if needed at pre-sprint meetings. | Projects |
| Sprint Planning | SPrint planning docs | No estimation??? | 
| Sprint Execution & Tracking | asldkfjaslkdf | asldgalksd |
| Sprint Review / Retrospective | After each sprint, a review and retrospective was conducted. Miro boards were used to facilitated retrospective meetings and are added as documentation in this repo. Finally, to facilitate participation from everyone in the team, forms were sent to those who could not attend so that they could offer their feedback for sprint review and retro asynchronously. | [meeting docs](admin/meetings) |
| Daily Stand-Ups | It was discussed in the course that due to size of the teams and logistics, variations to this framework could be modified. Based on this, we created a `#stand-up` channel where team members could share `what they did`, `next steps`, `blockers`, and any `help needed`. It was defined that team members should post every other day in this channel, and reminders were added to the team calendar. | idk |
| Code Consistency | To maintain code consistency, a style guide was enforced with `prettier` and `eslint`. | ADR? |
| Code Commenting | asdlgkjasldkgj | askdghalskg |
| Code Decomposition | asdfasd | asdgadg |
| Code Linting and Style Enforcement | uh oh i need to distinguish btw this and consistency? | Adr ? | 
| Unit Testing | We used `jest` to align our tools with the course. We also implemented code coverage and aimed for an 85% coverage rate with our tests. The tests were integrated into our CICD pipeline | ADR? |
| E2E Testing | We used `puppeteer` to aligin our tools with the course. alskdjgalskdjglsakdjg | ADR? | 
| Hand Testing | Performed and documented .... | Link to documnentation | 
| "Dog Fooding" | tf | Asfasdf |
| Stakeholder Feedback | We attended weekly TA meetings to get feedback from the TA asldfkasdlga | asdgasdg |
| Outisde User Acceptance Testing | To conduct user acceptance testing, we created a form to send out to users, asking them about their experience with the site. We made the form easily accessible. Though the project is "finished" at this point, the results of this form would be used to iterate and improve the site as we continue to maintain it. | Link to form |
| Team Communications | We used Slack for communications. At the beginning of each sprint, it was communicated clearly who was in what team, and the outline of tasks for that team. Channels were made for each team and team members were encouraged to reach out if they had questions, whether that was in their small team chat or the whole team chat. Guidelines were outlined in the Sprint Planning docs to acknowledge Slack messages and keep notifications on. | Link |
