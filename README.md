| Category | What we did | Links |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Pull request reviewing | For each PR, at least one person reviewed it. For each team, we also had assigned reviewers. Due to responsiveness and/or time constraints, sometimes we didn't have time for the assigned reviewer to review, but it was always reviewed by someone else. To review, we would render the code on our side, check it over visually, and check the diffs. | [Closed PRs](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) |
| Branching use | Branching name strategy: name-what-you-did | [Branches](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/branches)<br> [Branching Strategy ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/050925-Branching-Strategy.md) |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Linting, formatting, tests (with coverage): unit tests, end to end tests, browser tests, JSDocs | [Folder](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/tree/main/admin/cipipeline)<br> [CI Pipeline ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/051025-CICD-Pipeline-Decisions.md) [Playwright ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/06072025-playwright.md) |
| Issue Tracking | Used a feature format, linked issues to project boards with parent issues, kept these boards up to date. | [Github Projects ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/052025-github-projects.md)<br> [Issues](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/issues)<br> [Projects](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/projects?query=is%3Aopen) |
| Repo use: Tagging/releases | Our branching strategy is highly conducive to frequent releases. After incremental development on `develop`, our first release to `main` was on 06.04.2025. Our final release to main was on 06.08.2026 | [The_club_triton](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton) |
| Docs (README.md) | Repository-wide READMEs are in-depth (see this README and [The_club_triton](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton) and are informative entry points for their respective audiences (this README is geared toward the TA, the site README is geared towards the user). Directory-wide READMEs give quick descriptions of the directory and credit to teammates if appropriate. | [Original Repository](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton)<br> [The_club_triton](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13) |
| Design Related Docs | We created wireframes for our initial designs, game flows, collected inspiration for page designs, and mocked out designs before coding. | [design-docs](admin/design-docs) |
| UCD Related Docs | From the pitch to the end of the project, we kept user stories in mind as we created our issues. Check the linked document for a list of the user stories we continually referenced. | [user-stories.md](specs/design-docs/user-stories.md) |
| Architectural Related Docs | For any architecture-related decisions we made, we created in-depth ADRs detailing the reasonings behind our decision. | [ADRs](specs/adrs) |
| System Related Docs | We created system diagrams for the general flow of the site as well as system diagrams for our CICD pipeline. | [Folder](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/tree/main/admin/cipipeline)<br> [System diagrams](specs/system-diagrams) | 
| Team & Managerial Related Docs | Every team/managerial related document that was referenced as an assignment in Canvas is uploaded to its correct spot. We also have other documents, such as meeting plans, sprint plans, and Miro boards in this repository. | [Meetings](admin/meetings)<br> [Sprint Planning Docs](admin/meetings/sprint-planning-docs) |
| Developer Docs | Every time a PR is successfully merged to `develop`, our JSDocs workflow is triggered, updating our developer docs. This provides updated, close-to-the code documentation for developers to use. They can also reference our system-docs, design-docs, and ADRs. | [Pipeline description](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/admin/cipipeline/phase2.md)<br> [ADRs](specs/adrs)<br> [Design docs](admin/design-docs)<br> [System diagrams](specs/system-diagrams) |
| Doc Location & Doc DX | We keep our code-related docs close to the code, in a clearly labeled `docs` folder located in the root of the repository. | [Docs](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/tree/develop/docs) |
| Doc Synchonicity with Code/System | Our system diagrams (pipeline and website flow) have different versions, including a most-updated version. Our developer docs are updated **as the code is updated**, so they are synchronous with each other. | [Pipeline description](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/admin/cipipeline/phase2.md)<br> [Docs](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/tree/develop/docs) |
| Backlog Use | We used Github Issues and Project Boards (specifically the `Backlog` column) to keep track of our backlog. Per the Agile methodology, backlogs were sorted through and updated at sprint reviews, then added to if needed at pre-sprint meetings. | [Projects](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/projects?query=is%3Aopen)<br> [Issues](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/issues) |
| Sprint Planning | Before each sprint, we conducted a sprint planning meeting. In this meeting, we discussed the backlog and estimated our capacity as a team to complete a subset of the backlog. | [Sprint Planning Docs](admin/meetings/sprint-planning-docs) | 
| Sprint Execution & Tracking | Learning from our experience with Sprint 1, we used in-depth, clear, sprint documents to guide each sprint. These sprint docs even included guidelines and suggested workflow. We also used Github projects and Issues to track our Sprint execution, which we got better and better at as the sprints continued. | [Sprint Planning Docs](admin/meetings/sprint-planning-docs)<br> [Projects](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/projects?query=is%3Aopen)<br> [Issues](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/issues) |
| Sprint Review / Retrospective | After each sprint, a review and retrospective was conducted. Miro boards were used to facilitated retrospective meetings and are added as documentation in this repo. Finally, to facilitate participation from everyone in the team, forms were sent to those who could not attend so that they could offer their feedback for sprint review and retro asynchronously. | [Meeting docs](admin/meetings) |
| Daily Stand-Ups | It was discussed in the course that due to size of the teams and logistics, variations to this framework could be modified. Based on this, we created a `#stand-up` channel where team members could share `what they did`, `next steps`, `blockers`, and any `help needed`. It was defined that team members should post every other day in this channel, and reminders were added to the team calendar. | Slack |
| Code Consistency | To maintain code consistency, a style guide was enforced with `prettier` and `eslint`. | [Code style guide ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/060725-code-style-and-format.md) |
| Code Commenting | Because we are all learners working on the same project, we understand the importance of well-placed, informative comments. We followed comment rules defined in our style guide. JSDoc comments were also checked as a part of our CI pipeline, so they were baked into our continuous integration/development of code. | [The_club_triton repo](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton) |
| Code Decomposition | We have clear `pages`, `scripts`, and `styles` directory, adhering to "separation of concerns". Interactive elements such as the navbar are separated for maintainability. The card element and database is also separated for modularity and maintainability. | [The_club_triton repo](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton) |
| Code Linting and Style Enforcement | We looped this into our CICD pipeline which kept linting and style constant and easy to enforce. | [Pipeline description](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/admin/cipipeline/phase2.md) | 
| Unit Testing | We used `jest` to align our tools with the course. We also implemented code coverage and aimed for an 85% coverage rate with our tests. The tests were integrated into our CICD pipeline in the spirit of continuous integration. | [Jest ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/060725-jest.md)<br> [The_club_triton tests](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/tree/develop/__tests__) |
| E2E Testing | We used `puppeteer` to align our tools with the course. One of its drawbacks was that it only tests on Chromium, which is why we later looped in browser testing with Playwright. | [Puppeteer ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/060725-puppeteer.md) | 
| Hand Testing | Hand testing was performed throughought development of the project and this can be seen in the Files in our numerous Slack channels. We have also put together hand testing documentation displaying our most informative screenshots and the bugs that they helped us solve. | [Hand testing docs](admin/hand-and-end-user-tests/hand-testing-docs) | 
| "Dog Fooding" | We "dogfooded" our site regularly to identify animation issues, usability issues, and bugs. Each of us has probably played the game at least 30 times. | This is evident in our issues as well as our conversations on Slack. |
| Stakeholder Feedback | We attended weekly TA meetings to get feedback from the TA. At each sprint review meeting, we demoed our progress and received feedback from the general team. Team leaders commonly gave feedback on implementations and consulted with designers who knew the premise of the game better than they. | Team meetings, sprint reviews, and Slack conversations all exemplify this. |
| Outisde User Acceptance Testing | To conduct user acceptance testing, we created a form to send out to users, asking them about their experience with the site. We made the form easily accessible. Though the project is "finished" at this point, the results of this form would be used to iterate and improve the site as we continue to maintain it. | [Link to form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6G2w56x0YxmaPzBKWFPoddjs2lPJH4QqLqW7SDcwNWOhryw/viewform?usp=dialog) [User acceptance docs](admin/hand-and-end-user-tests/end-user-acceptance) |
| Team Communications | We used Slack for communications. At the beginning of each sprint, it was communicated clearly who was in what team, and the outline of tasks for that team. Channels were made for each team and team members were encouraged to reach out if they had questions, whether that was in their small team chat or the whole team chat. Guidelines were outlined in the Sprint Planning docs to acknowledge Slack messages and keep notifications on. We also used a team calendar to keep track of dates and meetings. | Slack<br> [Sprint Planning Docs](admin/meetings/sprint-planning-docs)<br> [Team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y183MDQzZjdlYjA2N2IxMGE3MGViMjcxY2UxNzBlYzg4ZDliY2QwNDFkNDdiMWM2OTA5YWFjM2M4ZDIzMTczMWZiQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) | 
| Team Communications (Meetings) | We conducted pre-sprint, retrospective, and review meetings. In each meeting, it was a focus for the leaders that every team member that wants to be heard was heard. For reviews and retros, the leaders also offered alternate forms of participation if making the meeting was impossible. | [Meeting docs](admin/meetings) |

## âœ… The -ilities
| Category | What we did | Links |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Functional Stability | Ensured the site was functional through unit, end to end, and browser testing. We aimed for high coverage to improve the quality of these tests. We added handling in case cards did not load in our database so that the user would be informed and the error gracefully handled. Our CICD pipeline also enabled stability because we were able to develop incrementally by passing the pipeline. | [The_club_triton tests](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/tree/develop/__tests__)<br> [Pipeline description](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/admin/cipipeline/phase2.md) |
| Performance Efficiency | We optimized image size and used next-gen formats to reduce loading time for our users. We also integrated Lighthouse Audits into our CI pipeline so that it was always a priority in our development. | [Lighthouse ADR](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/cse110-sp25-group13/blob/main/specs/adrs/060725-lighthouse.md) |
| Compatibility (Interoperability) | We used Playwright for browser testing across Chromium, Firefox and Webkit. We also used semantic HTML and HTML validation. | [Playwright ADR](specs/adrs/06072025-playwright.md)<br> [Code base](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/) |
| Usability | We designed our site with 3 simple, clearly defined pages, with instructions on 2 pages. There is a clear and easy to use nav bar visible across all pages. To improve readability, the user can hover over cards to increase their size. (how ppl won in each round??) | asdgasdg |
| Reliability | For our branching strategy, we have a separate `main` and `develop` branch so that we always have a working version of our site. For the reliable retrieval of cards from our database, we use a local read from a `json` file. We also have font fallbacks in case the custom fonts we use do not load. We also created a custom 404PageNotFound page that directs the user back to our home page, and this will be accessed if the url doesn't match one of our pages. | [404 Page](https://cse110-sp25-group13.github.io/The_club_triton/404.html) |
| Accessibility | Added textual and visual representation of rankings for our cards. Increased the zoom when hovering over for better visibility. Purposely chose colors that would be distinguishable even if someone is color-blind. Added `alt` for images and links. Used semantic HTML tags like nav, button, and main. | THE SITE? |
| Maintainability | We designed a robust CICD pipeline featuring unit, e2e, browser tests, linting, formatting, doc generation, and code coverage, which facilitates the maintainability of our application. We also designed a custom card element so that changes to the card schema could be made simply. Furthermore, the navbar element has separate code which also increases maintainability. | [Final CICD Pipeline diagram](specs/system-docs/cipipeline-system-diagram.png)<br> [Code base](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/) |
| Portability | We implemented dynamic file paths for localhost vs Github pages rendering. We also added browser testing to make sure that our site renders correctly on multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). We limited dependencies and spread of tool usage in the spirit of portability and maintainability as well. | [The_club_triton tests](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group13/The_club_triton/tree/develop/__tests__)<br> [Playwright ADR](specs/adrs/06072025-playwright.md) |
